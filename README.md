# Netflix-Recommendation

I am excited to share my first project, the Netflix Recommendation Model, with you all. This is my first attempt at creating a Machine learning model and I am still on my learning journey. I tried to make it as good as possible, but being my first project, I understand there is room for improvement. I plan on updating the model as I continue to learn and improve my skills. Am facing issue with Heruko but soon will solve that error.

The reason I am posting it now is to track my progress and see how far I have come. It is also a great opportunity to receive feedback and suggestions on how I can improve my model.

The Netflix Recommendation Model uses basic libraries and techniques to provide quick and simple movie recommendations on individual Geners basics for Netflix users. The model is built using Python, a popular language in the data science community, and utilizes data science concepts such as collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations.

Netflix is known for its sophisticated recommendation system, which is a key factor in the company's success. The Netflix Recommendation Model aims to replicate some of the basic principles behind the Netflix recommendation system. By using this model, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how recommendation systems work and how I can improve my skills in this field.

I hope you find my project interesting and I am looking forward to your feedback. I plan on writing a great blog post to explain my model in more detail and to provide additional resources for anyone interested in learning more about recommendation systems.

Thank you for taking the time to check out my project. I can't wait to see where this journey takes me.

As said it smy first project and will keep updating the Project as and when I upskill my knowledge.
